## What is Sanity CMS?

Sanity is the world's #1 headless CMS (content management system), providing businesses with a flexible way of handling all their content in one central location. Sanity describes its product as "the platform for structured content that lets your team work together in real-time to build engaging digital experiences across channels."

With a "headless" approach to content management, we treat your content as structured data that we can display anywhere. We can pull your content into a website layout, emails, apps, anywhere. When it's time for a brand new website, your content can live on in the new solution without starting from scratch. And that's why it's called "headless" - you can place any head on your body of content.

## Is Sanity the best CMS?

Sanity is the leading headless CMS in the world. Is it the best overall CMS, though? We don't trust people who talk in absolutes because, most of the time, the truth is that "it depends".

Whether Sanity CMS is the best option for your next project depends on your current and future needs. If you need a simple but custom website, Webflow may be the better option. Don't hesitate to contact us to help you evaluate your project and recommend a CMS that suits your project.

If you're considering WordPress, do yourself a favor and educate yourself on all the reasons why WordPress might be a bad idea!

## What is Sanity used for?

Sanity is used for managing content like text, images, video, and other media via APIs. Use cases span from a simple website to managing the content of Puma's omnichannel e-commerce to our latest project building the CMS backend for an interactive video streaming service.

Many use cases fit Sanity's "Free forever" plan. If you need additional quota or non-admin users, you might need the $99/month Team plan. The next level with 20 non-admin users, SSO, and more is $949/month as of March 2022. The next and last step is the Enterprise plan for large organizations with business-critical applications. Sanity does not list any Enterprise pricing publically. Contact us if you want some more details about Sanity's enterprise offering. See Sanity's plans and pricing here.

## Security and Data storage in Sanity

Your data is stored in what Sanity calls "The Sanity Content Lake", which runs in the cloud and is fully managed by Sanity. You access the Content Lake via the Sanity API, either using one of Sanity's client libraries or directly via the HTTP API.

Sanity takes its security very seriously. Sanity.io is a SOC 2 Type 1 certified provider, fully GDPR-compliant, and hosts its infrastructure on the Google Cloud Platform that undergoes regular independent audits for a range of standards, including ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, SOC 2, SOC 3, CSA STAR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. Read more about how Sanity handles security.

Sanity is a schemaless database built on top of Google cloud. The API comes with the GROQ query language. It lets you filter and fetch content quickly and present it using your preferred programming language and structure.

Choosing where to host the content for your business is an important decision. When evaluating options, we go deep into the products and also the companies behind the products. We place our deepest trust in Sanity based on their product, the speed and direction of their development, and the team behind Sanity.

Sanity raised $9.3 million in 2020 in its Series A and another $39 million in its 2021 Series B. Sanity has not stopped impressing us in 2022-2023, landing an investment from the worlds leading e-commerce player Shopify.

Sanity's impressive development as a company, combined with its leading position among business owners and developers, makes us confident to keep investing in Sanity.

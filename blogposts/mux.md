## Mux becomes first platform to unify all video formats, accelerating how developers build rich front-end video experiences

SAN FRANCISCO, May 24, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Mux, the leading video infrastructure platform, today announced the availability of Mux Real-Time Video, providing developers with an intuitive solution for building multi-party communication functionality into any application. Real-Time Video seamlessly integrates with Mux's existing offerings, including video on-demand and live video, giving developers a one-stop shop for all their communication, recording, broadcasting, and streaming requirements.

With more than 80 percent of all Internet traffic today now video developers are bringing video into every type of web and application experience. Beyond the mature streaming video market that's forecasted to reach $94 billion by 2024 the emergent real-time video market powered by WebRTC is expected to experience a growth rate of 43 percent annually and reach nearly $40 billion by 2027. Mux is a platform that serves the global audience of developers creating native video experiences in their applications and web sites.

Unlike live video, which is a one-to-many format where seconds or even minutes of latency can be acceptable, real-time video is a many-to-many format, where latency must be 150 milliseconds or less for seamless user experiences. Popularized by Zoom and other web conferencing solutions, real-time video is taking web sites and application experiences by storm, creating massive opportunities to accelerate business opportunities. With easy integration, documentation and support, flexible SDKs, and transparent pricing, developers can leverage Mux Real-Time Video for a host of use cases, including:

**Online events** - from professional meetings with a handful of people, to webinars, to conferences

**Fitness and Wellness** - beyond live streamed classes where attendees can watch but not interact, fitness professionals can conduct personalized coaching or host smaller, more engaging classes

**Collaboration** - Augment your application with collaborative video. Whether you're building a graphic design tool, presentation software, or CMS, collaborating through video can be more engaging and productive

**Education** - leverage the flexibility of Real-Time Video to build features that maximize engagement and participation from students in e-learning settings

Mux Real-Time Video is now available in public beta. With 1000 free participant minutes every month, and additional minutes costing $0.004 with no minimum, there's no cost to get started and no commitment as you stream. Interested developers and enterprises can contact the Mux team for access.

Along with the launch of Real-Time Video at their inaugural customer conference, The Mux Informational (TMI), Mux is also previewing products built on top of their Real-Time Video offering, including Live Studio, an offering that will enable developers to produce high quality live streams directly from web browsers with only a few lines of code, making live streaming more accessible than ever.

## Why should you use Redux with Next.js?

There are a lot of reasons why you might want to use Redux in a Next application. Let’s take a look at some of them.

## Sharing state

Usually, a central state is used to manage the shared data between the components in a tree. In React, data flows only downwards, which means you can pass data from the parent component to a child component.

This limitation sometimes makes things hard because the components might not be close in the component tree, and there might not even be a parent-child path.

In this case, using a common store that wraps all the components makes total sense, and you might consider Redux.

## Redux is very powerful

Redux is very powerful as a state management solution. It’s been around for a while, so it has excellent community support.

If you are building something severe and unsure which use cases might appear in the future, more likely than not, Redux will have a solution for you. While nothing is entirely future-proof, Redux is a safe bet for long-term projects.

## Everybody knows Redux

In many projects, speed is often a priority. Many React developers are already familiar with Redux, and companies often want to use the same tool, if possible, across all of the projects.

This means even if you are working in a company building a new project in Next, you might be forced to use Redux anyway, so it’s a good idea to learn how to use it based on popularity alone.

## Redux is very flexible

One of the major reasons why Redux is so popular is its flexibility. Redux provides a wide range of features, middleware, caching, and performance. It has a very active and vibrant developer community. Also, Redux can separate the concerns inside your application, resulting in better code management in the future.

If you start using Redux in your application, you won’t be limited by its features. In fact, it will open up a lot of new possibilities. You can choose to incorporate these features in your application or not.
